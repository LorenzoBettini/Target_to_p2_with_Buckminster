This project contains the files to materialize the target plaftorm with *Buckminster*, using a CSPEC, CQUERY and RMAP.

The target platform will consist of


* org.eclipse.rcp
* org.eclipse.rcp.source
* org.eclipse.emf.sdk
* org.eclipse.equinox.executable



This will allow you to get a target platform where _all the required software is materialized_, *without* giving up the _possibility to build an RCP product for multiple environments_ (not only the current one).
