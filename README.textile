This is the source code for the tutorial that can be found here:

"":http://www.lorenzobettini.it/2012/11/materializing-and-provisioning-your-target-platform-as-local-p2-site-with-buckminster/

This is an example showing how to create a target platform to be materialized by *Buckminster*, using a CSPEC, CQUERY and RMAP.

The target platform will consist of


* org.eclipse.rcp
* org.eclipse.rcp.source
* org.eclipse.emf.sdk
* org.eclipse.equinox.executable



This will allow you to get a target platform where _all the required software is materialized_, *without* giving up the _possibility to build an RCP product for multiple environments_ (not only the current one).

From the target platform we will then build a p2 repository with all the bundles of the so defined target platform (feature bucky.example.rcpemf.target.site).  We also build a p2 repository with all the installable units of the so defined target platform (bucky.example.rcpemf.target.mirror.site), which can then be considered as a local mirror of the so defined target platform.
